This project is aimed at replacing the existing tech widget overlay found here https://github.com/Treee/tech-widget-overlay with a solution not bound by framework since maintaining this overlay is sporadic and the framework updates more than I care to support.

- for sound to work without interacting with the screen you must whitelist the client url in your chrome browser `google chrome autoplay settings`
